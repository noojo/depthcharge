[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/leetreveil/musicmetadata.png)](http://travis-ci.org/leetreveil/musicmetadata) [![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url]

[![browser support](https://ci.testling.com/leetreveil/musicmetadata.png)](https://ci.testling.com/leetreveil/musicmetadata)

Streaming music metadata parser for node and the browser.

Installation
------------
Install via [npm](http://npmjs.org):

```
npm install musicmetadata
```

Or with [bower](http://bower.io) if you're in the browser:

```
bower install musicmetadata
```

If you're old'skool you can also download the latest tar ball from https://github.com/leetreveil/musicmetadata/releases.


Supports
-----------------
* mp3 (1.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4)
* m4a (mp4)
* vorbis (ogg, flac)
* asf (wma, wmv)


API
-----------------
```javascript
var fs = require('fs');
var mm = require('musicmetadata');

// create a new parser from a node ReadStream
var parser = mm(fs.createReadStream('sample.mp3'));

// listen for the metadata event
parser.on('metadata', function (result) {
  console.log(result);
});
```

You can also read the duration; reading the duration may be slow so only set this if you need to.
```javascript
var parser = mm(fs.createReadStream('sample.mp3'), { duration: true });
```


This will output the standard music metadata:

```javascript
{ artist : ['Spor'],
  album : 'Nightlife, Vol 5.',
  albumartist : [ 'Andy C', 'Spor' ],
  title : 'Stronger',
  year : '2010',
  track : { no : 1, of : 44 },
  disk : { no : 1, of : 2 },
  picture : [ { format : 'jpg', data : <Buffer> } ],
  duration : 302 // in seconds
}
```

If you just want the artist - listen for the artist event:

```javascript
parser.on('artist', function (result) {
  console.log(result);
});
```

You can also listen for custom metadata types that are not part of the standard metadata as defined above. For example if you wanted to read the `TLEN` frame from a id3v2.x file you can do this:

```javascript
parser.on('TLEN', function (result) {
  console.log(result);
});
```

The ```done``` event will be raised when parsing has finished or an error has occurred. This could be
used to disconnect from the stream as soon as parsing has finished, saving bandwidth.

```javascript
parser.on('done', function (err) {
  if (err) throw err;
  stream.destroy();
});
```
